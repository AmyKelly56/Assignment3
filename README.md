OOP Assignment 3


The project is an application based in Swift for iOS devices (iPad, iPod, iPhone). There is two main parts to the application. There is a total of 7 classes.  

On the main storyboard which you are presented with on opening of the application presents two options of "Album Info" and "Music Player". The transtion to either of these sections is performed through a modally segue. The "Album Info" section contains album inforamtion such as the album artwork, a brief background about the album and the songs that are on the album. This information is all stored in a library using a struct template to hold the information. The images are then populated through an array. The remainder of the information is updated throught the updateUI() function when an album has been selected. The transition from the album image to the information is also preformed through a segue. If the information for a specific album does not fit entirely on the screen then a scroll option will automatically be presented. The Album Class passes the information required by the Album View Controller to load all content. 

The "Music Player" section of the application
